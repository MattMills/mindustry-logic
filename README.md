## mega-poly-safety.logic
This file looks at the radar of a selected foreshadow and ripple, and when enemies are present it tells megas and polys to move to the rally point so they are protected, then releases them once the enemies are gone to go heal and rebuild. This prevents all my polys or megas from getting murdered by a single guardian in 1 round.

It also runs a large display with green = no enemies and power availability > 90%, yellow = power < 90%, and red = enemies detected.
