## mega-poly-safety.logic
This file looks at the radar of a selected foreshadow and ripple, and when enemies are present it tells megas and polys to go to move to the rally point, then releases them once the enemies are gone to go heal and rebuild.

It also runs a large display with green = no enemies and power availability > 90%, yellow = power < 90%, and red = enemies detected.
